Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> commands
Rule 1     commands -> empty
Rule 2     commands -> commands command
Rule 3     command -> heatswitch
Rule 4     command -> targetset
Rule 5     heatswitch -> TOKHEAT STATE
Rule 6     targetset -> TOKTARGET TOKTEMPRATURE NUMBER
Rule 7     empty -> <empty>

Terminals, with rules where they appear

NUMBER               : 6
STATE                : 5
TOKHEAT              : 5
TOKTARGET            : 6
TOKTEMPRATURE        : 6
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

command              : 2
commands             : 2 0
empty                : 1
heatswitch           : 3
targetset            : 4

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . commands
    (1) commands -> . empty
    (2) commands -> . commands command
    (7) empty -> .

    TOKHEAT         reduce using rule 7 (empty -> .)
    TOKTARGET       reduce using rule 7 (empty -> .)
    $end            reduce using rule 7 (empty -> .)

    commands                       shift and go to state 1
    empty                          shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> commands .
    (2) commands -> commands . command
    (3) command -> . heatswitch
    (4) command -> . targetset

    (6) targetset -> . TOKTARGET TOKTEMPRATURE NUMBER

    TOKHEAT         shift and go to state 6
    TOKTARGET       shift and go to state 7

    (5) heatswitch -> TOKHEAT . STATE

    STATE           shift and go to state 8


state 7

    (6) targetset -> TOKTARGET . TOKTEMPRATURE NUMBER

    TOKTEMPRATURE   shift and go to state 9


state 8

    (5) heatswitch -> TOKHEAT STATE .
